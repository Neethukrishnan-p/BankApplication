# BankApplication
This is a first level bank application I have done through my angular studies. Will be adding new features in future.

I have provided a static database for now.


Steps to following while launching the application 

    1. Ensure whether npm is installed--> command - npm -v

    2. If not--> command - npm i -g @angular/cli@latest
    
    3. To open the server--> command - ng serve --open
